MAr1 Board Changes/Issues

1. SW7 footprint is incorrect (decide on toggle switch)
2. D2 footprint is incorrect (too small for SMA)
3. R68 -> 220R
4. Add an LED and 200R on VC3 for debug
5. Add through-hole power jack footprint for debug
7. U5, U6, U7 (CD4511B) footprint is TSSOP-16 (#CD4511BPWR) on PCB, ordered SOIC-16.  Order new parts... consider changing PCB
8. Increase hole size for pots
9. PDI interface has wrong pinouts... must rewire and edit PCB to communicate to AVR Dragon.  See: http://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/user-manual/avrdude_20.html#Troubleshooting
10. 7 Segment LEDs seem to be upside down, middle seg is swapped with DP
